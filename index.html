        <p>here are some data that colleted from Wikipedia</p>
        <p>I would like to search Wikipedia for some information on a specific topic. In this case I am searching for the Renaissance. So all information containing the keyword "renaissance" can be captured by this scraper. I will then add as many images and even videos as I can to make the information under this entry more informative and complete.
